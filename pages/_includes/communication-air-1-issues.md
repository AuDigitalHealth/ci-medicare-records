        <td>The enhanced use of immunisation records work brief calling out ‘immunisation exemptions’ part of notices only and the brief appears to occasionally imply that this would be categorised. Services Australia and their current data should drive this design –
are these categorised internally, can they provide a category like medical contraindication or natural immunity? One potential solution for that is adding an additional category in addition to the fixed code of
1500551000168103 | Australian Immunisation Register notice|. The additional values can be drawn from <a href="https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/reason-vaccine-not-administered-1">https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/reason-vaccine-not-administered-1</a>. </td>
