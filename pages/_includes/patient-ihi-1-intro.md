#### Patient with Mandatory IHI *[[Draft](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/valueset-publication-status.html)]*
The purpose of this profile is to define a representation of a patient for exchange usage scenarios in an Australian context where unambiguous identification of a patient is mandatory. This profile is intended to support the electronic exchange of health information between healthcare providers in Australia.

#### Implementation guidance
For the overarching usage scenarios in this implementation guide it is expected that:
* If a resource is referenced rather than identified in the applicable element, the referenced resource should be [contained](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/references.html#contained)
