## Introduction

This implementation guide is an HL7<sup>TM</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup> specification to represent Medicare information for the My Health Record system and related applications.

This [implementation guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/implementationguide.html#scope) is based on [FHIR Release 3 (STU) [HL7FHIR3]](#HL7FHIR3).

This implementation guide is not to be used as a guide to presentation (or rendering) of the data. It contains no information as to how the data described by it should be displayed and no such guidance should be inferred.

This implementation guide does not describe transport or persistence mechanisms of the resources described by it.

This implementation guide does not include mappings to another format, for more information see the applicable resource documentation in the [FHIR Release 3 (STU) [HL7FHIR3]](#HL7FHIR3).
## Usage Scenarios
The FHIR profiles for each usage scenario are listed below. 
###  Australian Immunisation Register
Profiles that define the representation of vaccination information from the Australian Immunisation Register:

###  Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS) and Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)

## Editorial note
This implementation guide is an early working specification that is available for comment and review. It may be used to solicit feedback and to provide insight as to the expected content in a forthcoming stable and approved version of the specification.

This implementation guide may not be considered to be complete enough or sufficiently reviewed to be safe for implementation and use in production systems. It may have known issues and still be in development.

## Known issues
This table lists known issues with this specification at the time of publishing. We are working on solutions to these issues and encourage comments to help us develop these solutions.

            <td>Material in this specification is based on existing standards and all efforts have been made to minimise divergence. Issues of an editorial nature in the source material (such as spelling or punctuation errors) are intentionally reproduced.</td>

Work is underway to ensure that these URLs resolve or redirect to a meaningful end point in the future.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Consent Australian Organ Donor Register</td>
            <td>This profile cannot be used for automated validation.
                <ul>
                    <li>All instances of Consent will fail validation against this profile as nothing can satisfy the required slice category:organDonationConsent. Its use of fixedCodeableConcept does not set discriminator values in a way suitable for slicing.</li>
                    <li>All instances of Consent will fail validation against this profile as nothing can satisfy the implementations of invariants <span style="font-family:courier;">inv-dh-cons-01</span> and <span style="font-family:courier;">inv-dh-cons-02</span>. In the FHIRPath expressions the antecedents are always true, so e.g. an instance with donation-decision of 'permit' and with a specific organ (except.data.reference) will fail with an error against <span style="font-family:courier;">inv-dh-cons-02</span>.</li>
                    <li>Instances of Consent that contain parts of Consent.category:organDonationConsent or Consent.except.action that are intended to be optional, including text and coding.display, will be rejected. Values of CodeableConcepts are set using fixedCodeableConcept, which prohibits parts of CodeableConcept that are intended to be optional, including CodeableConcept.text and CodeableConcept.coding.display.</li>

            <td>This profile has very limited use for automated validation.
                <ul>
                    <li>Instances of Explanation of Benefit that include medications will fail validation against this profile due to its use of contained resources. In Explanation of Benefit Medicare the element prescription is a contained reference to Medication Request Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which includes a contained reference to Medication Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. FHIR does not allow nesting of contained resources.</li>
                    <li>Many true instances of Explanation of Benefit will fail validation against this profile as few things can satisfy the implementations of invariants <span style="font-family:courier;">inv-dh-eob-01</span> and <span style="font-family:courier;">inv-dh-eob-02</span>. In the FHIRPath expressions the antecedents are always true, so e.g. an MBS claim without a prescription instance fails validation.</li>
                </ul>

        <tr>
            <td>Australian Immunisation Register Immunisation</td>

                    <li>Instances of Immunisation that contain parts of Immunization.vaccinationProtocol.doseStatus that are intended to be optional, including text and coding.display, will be rejected. Values of CodeableConcepts are set using fixedCodeableConcept, which prohibits parts of CodeableConcept that are intended to be optional, including CodeableConcept.text and CodeableConcept.coding.display.</li>
